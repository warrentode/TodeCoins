This started out as a learning project for me since I decided I wanted to learn how to make Minecraft mods in Forge.

Since I also homeschool, it became a learning opportunity for all of us as I looked into various historical aspects related to the project. Sometimes I looked things up for my own sake. Other times I looked stuff up to answer my sons' questions. In any case, I've shared the links to all that in the sidebar of the wiki here in case anyone is interested in learning some random stuff like we have.

This mod adds a coin press, json driven trade types, trade currency, biome aware trade tables, a wallet to store currency, a tip jar, collectible coins, and a coin album for storing the collectible coins -  along with the Banker and Leprechaun villager professions as well as the Numismatist and Piglin Merchant to the game.
