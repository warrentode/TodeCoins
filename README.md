This started out as a learning project for me since I decided I wanted to learn how to make Minecraft mods in Forge. Since I also homeschool, it also became a learning opportunity for all of us as I looked into various historical aspects related to the project. Sometimes I looked things up for my own sake. Other times I looked stuff up to answer my sons' questions. In any case, I've shared the links to all that in the sidebar of the wiki here in case anyone is interested in learning some random stuff like we have.

This mod adds a coin press and currency along with the Banker and Leprechaun villager professions to the game.
