This started out as a learning project for me since I decided I wanted to learn how to make Minecraft mods in Forge.
Since I also homeschool, it also became a learning opportunity for all of us as I looked into various historical aspects
related to the project. Sometimes I looked things up for my own sake. Other times I looked stuff up to answer my sons'
questions. In any case, I've shared the links to all that in the sidebar of the wiki here in case anyone is interested
in learning some random stuff like we have.

This mod adds a coin press, trade-able currency, and collectible coins, along with the Banker and Leprechaun villager
professions as well as the Numismatist to the game.

Special thanks to my sons: MinePika94, MikieSteve, and EnderDragonRobot (known as Scholar Owl, Tuxedo Cat, and Little
Bear on my blog) for all their insight, suggestions, and input with this mod regarding features, testing, game play, and
balance!
